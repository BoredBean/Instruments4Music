# Instruments4Music
## Introduction：
This plugin aims to introduce some musical instruments to the Lethal Company. 

This plugin utilizes [LethalCompany InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/) for configuring key binds. 

**The developer has limited knowledge of C# or Unity, so this plugin may crash at any time in its current version.**

## How to use:
Aim at the cord of the ship’s alarm horn and press **"q"** for **3 seconds**.

You can then play the horn as an instrument.
| Note Name | C | D | E | F | G | H | I |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Higher | q | w | e | r | t | y | u |
| Mid | a | s | d | f | g | h | j |
| Lower | z | x | c | v | b | n | m |

Press **"tab"** to **exit** playing mode.

## Future Plans：
1.  Introduce more stationary or portable instruments.
2.  Implement a user interface for music playback.
3.  Prevent the player from moving or interacting with objects while playing music.
4.  Synchronize music playback with other players.

## Releases：
### Release v0.5.0
1. Converted the ship’s horn into a playable instrument.
