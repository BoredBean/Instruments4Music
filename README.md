# Instruments4Music
## Introduction：
This plugin aims to introduce some musical instruments to the Lethal Company. 

This plugin utilizes [LethalCompany InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/) for configuring key binds. 

**The developer has limited knowledge of C# or Unity, so this plugin may not work very well.**

**(Especially when you quit one room and then join another one.)**

## How to use:
Aim at a possible stationary instrument or holding a portable instrument and press **"LeftAlt"** for **2 seconds**.

Possible stationary instruments: Ship Horn, Light Switch, Pumpkin Head...

Possible portable instruments: Clown Horn, Air Horn, Air Blower...

<br />
  
You can then play an instrument with the default key bindings:
| Note Name | C | D | E | F | G | H | I |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Primary** |
| Higher | q | w | e | r | t | y | u |
| Mid | a | s | d | f | g | h | j |
| Lower | z | x | c | v | b | n | m |
| **Secondary** |
| Higher | / |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Mid | k | l | ; | n | m | , | . |
| Lower | y | u | i | o | p | h | j |

Press **"Shift"** to play **semitone**: C#, D#, F#, G#, A#

Press **"Ctrl"** as the **soft padel**.

Press **"Space"** as the **sustain padel**.

Press **"Tab"** to switch to the **secondary key binding** scheme.

Press **"ESC"** to **exit** playing mode.

## Future Plans：
1. ✅Introduce more stationary or portable instruments.
2. ✅Implement a user interface for music playback.
3. Prevent the player from moving or interacting with objects while playing music.
4. Synchronize music playback with other players.
5. Implement auto music playing function.
5. Add more custom configurations.
